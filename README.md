# Reinforcement Learning Part 2

<p>Part 2 of my Reinforcement Learning (RL) series. During this series, I dwell into the field of RL by applying various methods to video games to learn and understand how an algorthm can learn to play by itself. The motivation for doing this series is simply by pure interest and to gain knowledge and experience in the field of Machine Learning.

The litterature follow throughout this series is <em>Reinforcement Learning</em> "An Introduction" by Ricard S. Button and Andrew G. Barto.
